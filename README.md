# Fun_Valentines_Day_Virus ♡
Fun Little Virus (its not really a virus) that you can send on Valentines Day to ask to be your Valentine!
This is a vbscript file. It needs to be downloaded on the computer to work. 

Concept:
  If the user repetitively 10 times says No to be your valentine, it will show "F*** ***".
  If the user says "Yes", it shows an "I LOVE YOU <3".

You can change these options/text by opening the virus file through notepad.

1. Change Number of Times it asks when clicked No :
Change the Number "10" set to any number of times. (Please note that do not make this number higher as it will continuously loop and the computer might prompt crash if you put a higher number. To be safe please put a number between 1 and 20 ).

        If MyNum = 10 Then
        
2. Change the text it shows:
Change the text inbetween " ".

★ To Change text response for No (Line 9): 
  
       MsgBox "FUCK YOU!",0,"N4z1"
       
★ To Change text response for Yes (Line 12):

      MsgBox "I LOVE YOU <3",0,"N4z1"

★ To Change the title on Top, edit all the "N4z1" you can find on the notepad!.
